# 👋 Hi there! I'm Aya Ali

I'm a goal-driven software engineering student with a background in education and teaching. I thrive at the intersection of structure, creativity, and communication — combining technical skills with a passion for building user-friendly solutions that make everyday life easier.

Through projects like **Fritids-schema**, I've transformed ideas into functional tools while deepening my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy solving problems, organizing chaos, and creating intuitive digital experiences.
